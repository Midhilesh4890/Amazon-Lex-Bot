# Amazon-Lex-Bot Using AWS Lambda 
This code helps to connect the facebook via Amazon lex bot

Unzip the ngrok.zip file as I zip the file ngrok.exe due to space constraints

Bot is connected to my facebook account at this [page](https://www.facebook.com/Amazon-Lex-103276291883618)

Note: As of now the bot takes only basic commands like taking mobile numbers and all to check the whether it is working.

I am updating the lambda function to integrate with the bot
